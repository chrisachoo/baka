# Baka Documentation

Welcome to **Baka**, your beginner- and developer-friendly Git workflow guide. This documentation is broken into clear sections to help you configure your shell environment, define smart Git aliases, and build a faster, safer terminal workflow.

## 📖 Introduction

### Baka – Git Without the Foolishness

Baka (バカ) means "fool" in Japanese—because sometimes, Git makes you feel like one. But don’t worry, Baka is here to help! 🚀

Baka is a lightweight set of Git aliasing recommendations and terminal scripting patterns. Whether you're just getting started with Git or want to reduce typing and avoid mistakes, this guide will help you make Git usage **fast, easy, and foolproof**.

#### What is Baka?

Baka isn't a tool or package—it’s a set of community-friendly documentation and shell configuration ideas that simplify Git usage. With a combination of aliases, functions, and shell customizations, Baka helps you set up a more intuitive, streamlined Git experience.

#### Why Baka?
